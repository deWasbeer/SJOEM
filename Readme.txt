To use SJOEM run Start.py in an python 3 interpreter 
(e.g. Spyder in anaconda).
Make sure Scipy, Numpy and Matlibplot are installed.
This program was created in Spyder GUI using Anaconda
by continuum analytics (www.continuum.io)

After analysis is finished two ‘ANSYS-(…).txt’ files are created,
these files can be opened in ANSYS using the ‘read input file’ 
command of the File menu. 
Opening these files re-calculates the engineering model using FEM.
This way results can be compared to ANSYS.

Thank You.
